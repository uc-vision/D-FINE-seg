# D-FINE-seg Object Detection and Segmentation Framework (Train, Export, Inference)

This is a framework that implements [D-FINE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13842) architecture for object detection and adds a segmentation head, so you can train an object detection task or instance segmentation task. Detection architecture and loss used from the original [repo](https://github.com/Peterande/D-FINE), and training code adapted from [D-FINE-seg](https://github.com/ArgoHA/D-FINE-seg).
